# tip-calculator-app-js

This project created to improve my js skills,
before learn React library.

..*general project review
The app counts the tip for waiter.
We have to give two required values - bill cost and tip in percent.
If the cost will be divided into other persons, then we should click to checkbox button
and type count of people - this value must be the integer!
At the and we have to click the 'Calculate' button
and app return in div the results of completed form.
If we give wrong data, then app return error or if
the bill input and percent input will be empty, we will also get error.
